## Purpose of the Experiment ##

In a very humid and hot country like Singapore, soil moisture attracts disease and nefast insects. The purpose of the experiment is to test out whether watewring exclusively through a wicking approach (from the bottom of the soil) is

1. sufficient for the plant to grow
2. reducing the emergence of moisture related disease (fungus, alguae, mold, insects...)

## Approach - Experiment setup ##

The experiment looks at 3 different setups, compared with the existing traditional pots.

### From overflow catch-up to water source ###

1. Take an existing pot (50x20cm), add wicking ropes from the bottom water collection reservoir and up into the soil, at various levels into the ground (stages are roughly at 4cm above reservoir and 8-10cm above reservoir) to maintain moisture below the surface.
2. The moisture should not reach the surface, or barely.
3. Plant need to have been previously germinated and have roots long enough to reach the moist ground

### Dual layer germination tray ###

1. Drill holes in one of the germination trays (e.g. 1020) and fill with soil
2. Stack it over another tray (without hole...)
3. Water exclusively from the bottom tray
4. Through experimentation, find the right balance of watering so the soil is barely moist at the surface of the soil but plants have sufficient moisturee to grow
5. **Open question**: is a wicking rope necessary or better?

### Complete hydroponic system ###

1. _To be documented_ 
2. See folder *Hydroponic-System_CornerSeals* for 3D printed parts to improve the system.
